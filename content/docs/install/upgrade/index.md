# Upgrade

Select the platform that applies to your current Wiki.js instance:

::warning{title='Migrating from Wiki.js 2.x'}
See the [Migration from 2.x guide](upgrade/migration-v2) for upgrade instructions.
::

::danger{title='Migrating from Wiki.js 1.x'}
It's not possible to migrate from a Wiki.js 1.x installation directly. Either migrate to 2.x first or backup your content to a local folder / git repository and import it back in a new 3.x installation.
