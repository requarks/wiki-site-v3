# Site Management

> From the **Administration Area**, click on the **Sites** section from the sidebar navigation.

Multiple wiki sites can be hosted on the same Wiki.js instance. This allows you to clearly separate content belonging to different teams or products.

The following resources are tied to a site:

- Pages *(including history)*
- Comments
- Media Assets
- Site Configuration *(e.g. theme, locales, navigation, etc.)*

::warning{title='User Scope'}
Users reside at the global level and are **NOT** tied to a site. They can be allowed access to multiple sites at once. Use **Group Rules** to restrict a user access to one or more sites.
::

## Requirements

- Each site requires a **dedicated hostname** (sub-domain or domain).
- The server cannot listen on multiple network interfaces for different sites. If you have such need, you must either use a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) to handle traffic from different IPs or launch dedicated instances for each interface.

## Create a Site

Click on the **New Site** button. A dialog to create a new site will appear.

![New Site Dialog](/img/docs-admin-sites-new.png){.shadow}

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Enter a name for your site. It will be shown in the top-left corner of the site. |
| **Hostname** | Enter either a fully-qualified domain name (e.g. wiki.example.com) or `*` *(wildcard)* for a catch-all site. Note that there can only be 1 catch-all site. This is used to route requests to the proper site. If a request doesn't match any hostname, it will fallback to the catch-all site. |

Both values can be changed at any time later from the **General** page.

## Modify a Site

From the left sidebar, select the site you want to edit from the dropdown menu:

![Site Selector](/img/docs-admin-sites-dropdown.png){.rounded .shadow}

Sidebar menu items *(e.g. General, Analytics, etc.)* under the **Site** section will affect only the currently selected site.

The General page is where most of the site settings can be customized.
