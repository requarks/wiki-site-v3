# Extensions

Extensions are additional modules that can be installed on the server to enable extra functionality.

These extensions have specific dependencies that change based on the server OS and platform, which is why they are not included by default. Some are also quite large and are not included to keep the installation size to a minimum by default.

## Installation

From the **Administration Area**, click **Extensions** in the sidebar.

Extensions that can be installed automatically will have an <kbd>Install</kbd> button next to them. Otherwise a link to the manual instructions will be displayed.

::: tip Using Docker?
When running the Wiki.js docker image, most of these extensions are **already included and installed**.
