It's now easier than ever to build flows between multiple pages in your wiki thanks to page relations.

Quickly add fully customizable buttons to your page from the **Page Properties** dialog. Select where the link is positionned, add a label and caption, choose an icon and finally select the target *(can be another page or an external link)*.

Perfect for tutorials that spans over multiple steps / chapters, or to show related pages.
