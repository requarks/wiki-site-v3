One of the most requested feature is the ability to host multiple sites on the same Wiki.js instance. This is now natively supported in 3.0!

Each site have their own site settings (such as theme, modules, navigation, etc.). Users are however global to the instance. This allows for very flexible scenarios where users can access and edit multiple sites using the same login.

Sites are accessed via a hostname set in the Administration Area (domain or sub-domain) and one site can optionally be designated as a fallback / catch-all site.
