A developer preview of Wiki.js 3.0 is now available for advanced users that want to run it on their machine and try it out. This is NOT a beta and should NOT be used in production or in a publicly-accessible environment. Make sure you fully read the notice and instructions first and understand the implications.

A beta will be available in the coming weeks / months, once more features are stable and working.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

- It's **VERY BUGGY** and **VERY INCOMPLETE**!
- It has **NO SECURITY**! Roles and permissions are not enabled at the moment. Anyone can do anything, including accessing the administration area.
- You **CANNOT UPGRADE** to or from it! Newer releases will require a brand new install with an empty database.
- **NO SUPPORT** is provided! Install and use at your own risk.
- **DO NOT REPORT BUGS**! Most things are broken right now, we know!
- Don't try it if you're not comfortable with Docker and Node.js in general. There's no prebuilt docker image yet.

## Usage

Detailed instructions are available at the [project README](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/tree/vega#readme) on GitHub. You can either run it using VS Code Dev Containers *(recommended)* or natively on your host.

Make sure you fully read the instructions first.
